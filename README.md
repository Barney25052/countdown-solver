# Countdown Solver
A countdown solver written in varying levels of abstraction.

### What is Countdown
Countdown is a british TV show where contestents must solve various number and letter puzzles in a given time.
This project is focused on the numbers game in the show.

**The rules are as follows** 
- A random 3 digit number is selected as a target.
- The contestants are then given 6 numbers to try and reach that target.
- They may not re-use a number.
- The running total must always be an integer.
- They can only use 4 mathematical operations: add, subtract, multiply and divide.
- Whoever is closest to the final target wins.


There can be many ways to solve the puzzle sometimes, however this project will only focus on finding one solution for simplicity.

### Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project is to see how implementations differ between different languages.

The project will first be written in Python, then C and finally in Assembly.
